# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

This project implements various machine learning models from scratch using Python. The goal is to demonstrate a deep understanding of the mathematical principles behind these algorithms and showcase coding skills.

## Datasets

The project uses two datasets:

- ds1_train.csv
- ds1_test.csv
- ds2_train.csv
- ds2_test.csv

These datasets can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uTIVgqxMDpbuY935zBHE2eRyuxwAXNOO?usp=sharing).

Each dataset contains multiple examples, with each example represented by a set of features and a corresponding label. The dataset files are in CSV format, where each row represents an example, and the last column represents the label.

## Machine Learning Models

At least two of the following models have been implemented:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes
3. K Means Clustering
4. Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA)
5. Neural Networks

## Project Structure

For each implemented model, the following subtasks have been completed:

### Subtask 1: Mathematical Understanding

A detailed mathematical explanation of each chosen model, including underlying principles, assumptions, and equations.

### Subtask 2: Training and Prediction

Implementation of the model from scratch in Python, including functions for training and prediction. The model is trained on the provided training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset.

### Subtask 3: Hyperparameter Tuning

Implementation of a method to tune at least one hyperparameter of the chosen model, using techniques like grid search or random search.

### Subtask 4: Comparison with Scikit-Learn

Comparison of the implemented model with the corresponding scikit-learn version, including accuracy measurements on both training and test datasets.

## Code Organization

The code is organized into separate files for each subtask, maintaining modularity. For example:

- logistic_regression.py
- naive_bayes.py
- etc.

## Usage

[Include instructions on how to run the code, any dependencies required, and how to interpret the results]

## Evaluation Metrics

Appropriate evaluation metrics are used based on the problem type (classification or regression), such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or mean squared error.

## Note

This project uses basic libraries for data manipulation and visualization, but the core logic of the machine learning models is implemented from scratch.
